# Student-Connect-Project

Our platform will address the challenge of fragmented communication for university students and student clubs. It will offer features for:

1. Centralized Information: Providing a single hub for students to access comprehensive club information and stay updated on events.

2. Historical Data Utilization: Leveraging historical event data to enable clubs to target their audiences effectively and tailor events to student interests.

The platform aims to enhance university student clubs engagement by streamlining information access and optimizing event planning and promotion.
